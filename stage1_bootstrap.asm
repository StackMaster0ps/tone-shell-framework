; Stage1_Bootstrap.asm - Minimal Stage 1 Bootstrap Stub (x64)
; Description: This assembly stub would be the first code executed (e.g., from MBR or as a proxy DLL).
; It prepares the system for the next stage. Here we simulate it by directly calling Stage2.
;
; In a real bootkit (MBR) scenario, this might run in 16-bit mode, load the next stage from disk (via BIOS interrupts),
; then transition to 32/64-bit mode and jump to Stage2 code.
; In a DLL hijack scenario, this could be the DllMain of a malicious DLL that loads the real DLL and triggers Stage2.
;
; For demonstration, we'll assume we're already in a 64-bit process and simply call the Stage2 loader.

        extrn   LoadShellcode : proc     ; Reference to Stage2 loader function in C (Stage2_Loader.c)

        .code
Stage1Entry PROC
    ; [Stage1] Perform any necessary setup here (e.g., disable defenses, prepare environment).
    ; (No actual harmful actions are performed in this demo stub.)
    
    ; Hand off execution to Stage2 loader:
    call    LoadShellcode           ; Transfer control to Stage2 (load and execute the payload)
    
    ; In a real scenario, Stage1 might not return (it could jump directly to Stage2 or to the OS loader).
